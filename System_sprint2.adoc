=== S.1 List of components
The software includes the following modules:

. Perception module
. Mapping and localization
. Planning	
. Control

=== S.2 Provided functionality


==== S.2.1 Perception module

The module shall detect and localize obstacles and another vehicles

The module shall provide object tracking and path prediction 

==== S.2.2 Mapping and localization module

The module shall perform fusion of the sensors' data

The module shall perform road segmentation: detect drivable space, road defects 

==== S.2.3 Planning module

The module shall calculate the racing line (path and velocity) for a given track.

The module shall generate local path which takes into account vehicle's current state, obstacles on a road, and converges to a global path when possible.

All four wheels of the vehicle shall stay withing the track limits at all times.

The module shall calculate optimal strategy of avoiding obstacles and collecting bonuses, that depends on the penalties and bonuses for the aforementioned actions. 

When the system receives a safe stop request, the velocity profile of the calculated trajectory shall be updated so that the vehicle stops with a 1 m/s2 deceleration.

When the system receives a safe stop request, the velocity profile of the calculated trajectory shall be updated so that the vehicle stops with an emergency brake deceleration.

| Name | Move_to_the_pitlane 
| Scope    | System
| Level| Business summary
| Primary actor| Roborace or Racecar pilot
| Secondary actor| 
| Context of use| Racecar has to obey an instruction
| Preconditions| Racecar has received an order to move to the pitlane

Racecar is on the racetrack

| Trigger| System receives a request from Racecar pilot or from the Roborace team
| Main success scenario| * The system calculates the trajectory to the pitlane

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the pit

| Success guarantee| The Racecar has moved to the pit and stopped
| Extensions| A. There is no safe trajectory to enter the pitlane (due to obstacles)

* The system calculates the closest possible trajectory to the pitlane entrance

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the end of the calculated trajectory

B. The distance is not sufficient for dropping the speed enough to  enter the pitlane without using the emergency brake

* The system calculates the trajectory with making an additional race lap before entering the pitlane

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the pit

| Stakeholders and interests|
* Racecar Pilot (requests the car to return to pit)

* Roborace management (sets the race goals and policies)

* Roborace team (requests the car to return to pit)

* Roborace operations managers (set up and maintain the hardware)
