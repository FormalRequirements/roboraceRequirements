== Environment

=== Explanatory text
In the second iteration we refine the information and build the environment model, using the programming language. During modelling we identify implicit assumptions which should be carefully listed and further verified with the stakeholders.

=== E.2 Components

Racetrack:: 

We model the racetrack as the sequence of coordinate tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)] , which represent the coordinates of the points on the inside and outside line along the track. The first element of the sequence corresponds to the starting line. Note, that representing coordinates on a 2D plane we implicitely assume that the track is completely flat (which generally might not be true). We reflect this in the assumptions section.

====
The starting grid is modeled as an array of coordinates of the middles of the front lines of the starting grid positions. The n-th element of the array corresponds to the n'th place on the starting grid.

As the initial phases of the development focus on the key features of the software, some environment details are ignored (which should be reflected in the assumptions section). We assume that the track surface is flat, clean, in good conditions, with no potholes and not slippery. The impact of the racetrack surface conditions can be introduced later in the development. 

During the race the only traffic signs that appear are the flags shown by the Roborace team. We assume that this information is received via V2X interface rather than preceived visually.

As the localization information is provided by the Roborace, we do not consider landmarks. 

At the current stage of the Roborace championship driving on curbs is not allowed. As the curbs are located outside of a racetrack (behind the inside or outside line), we ignore their existence.

Vehicles :: Competing race cars can be modeled as the instances of a RACECAR

Obstacles :: The obstacles can be of a different nature: real and virtual, dynamic and static. Virtual obstacles are introduced by the Roborace team during the race. If the car hits the virtual obstacles it is ot damaged; yet the bonus or penalty time will be added to a total race time. Real obstacles currently are not present, yet there might be an unexpected obstacle on a racetrack (such as a stray dog or some object bought by the wind. We capture the commonality of the different obstacle types through inheritance mechanism.

Surroundings, spectators :: We ignore the surrondingd and spectators 

Weather conditions :: We ignore the weather conditions at the moment. 

Race control unit :: 

Telemetry system is the system that monitors current parameters of the race car. The developed software shall support the corresponding interface.

Race engineers take care of the hardware, which we ignore. Race engineers also check the software before the race which should be taken into account in the project development planning.

Race rules evolve through the championship so the model should support the change.

Vehicle operator :: The vehicle operator runs the software to start the race. He can also request a safe or emergency stop during the race. The corresponding interface should be developed.

Sensors :: We capture the commonalities between different types of sensors through the inheritance mechanism. 

.The `SENSOR` class
[source, eiffel]
----
deferred class
	SENSOR

feature
	position: LOCATION
		--location in the racecar coordinate system

	update_rate: REAL
		--sensor update rate
end
----

The abstract sensor class reflects the features common to all sensor. The class describing a particular sensor class inherits from a SENSOR class and further soecifies features applicable to that particular sensor type (see the example of the LIDAR class)

.The abstract `LIDAR` class
[source, eiffel]
----
deferred class
	LIDAR

inherit
	SENSOR
	
feature
	point_cloud: ARRAY2 [LOCATION]
		-- m by n matrix of detected points in lidar coordinate system

	distance: ARRAY2 [REAL]
		-- m by n matrix of distances to object points

	orientation: ORIENTATION
		-- Lidar orientation in the racecar coordinate system	

end

To combine all environment properties into one model, we create the ENVIRONMENT class which references all environment components:

.The abstract `ENVIRONMENT` class
[source, eiffel]
----
deferred class
	ENVIRONMENT

feature
	obstacles: BAG[OBSTACLE]
		--Set of detected obstacles on racetrack

	roborace: ROBORACE
		--Race control unit

	race: RACE
		--Current race details

	sensors: SENSORS
		--Set of sensos insalled of the vehicle

end
----

Here the Sensors class represents a particular sensors set. As the sensors location on a race car can be changed by the teams, this can be reflected upon creating an instance of SENSORS class and assigning particular location to each sensor.

.The `SENSORS` class
[source, eiffel]
----
deferred class
	SENSORS

feature
  -- The set of sensors corresponds to racecar specification
	lidar1: LIDAR
	lidar2: LIDAR
	radar1: RADAR
	radar2: RADAR
	gnss: GNSS
	camera1: CAMERA
	camera2: CAMERA
	odometer: ODOMETER

end

=== E.3 Constraints

Constraints turn into class invariant as these are the conditions that must hold at all times

[BR] A car starts a race positioned at the starting grid of the racetrack.

[BR] If there is no wheel slipping, a car is moving towards its heading direction

[BR] A car shall not accelerate and brake at the same moment [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

[BR] A car shall not drive on the curbs [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

[BR] A car may receive a speed limit during the race and shall react accordingly [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

[BR] The coordinates of obstacles and bonuses are sent in real time during the race  [how much ahead?] [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

=== E.4 Assumptions
The localization data is provided during the race in real time [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

The track 2d-map is provided before the race [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

The robocar and Devbot 2.0 have the same dynamics

All roborace participants are able to communicate in English

The measured vehicle’s speed equals to actual vehicle’s speed [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

The estimated vehicle’s pose equals to actual vehicle’s pose with an accuracy 5-10cm [source: interview with Ilya 09/03/21]

The influence of weather contitions on car dynamics is not taken into consideration and are captured as constraints on car acceleration.

The influence of tyre wear-off on car dynamics is not taken into consideration.

The influence of track surface degradation during the race is not taken into consideration.

The racetrack surface is clean and in good conditions

The racetrack surface is not slippery

=== E.5 Effects

* As the Roborace is initially created as a self-driving cars competition, the software implementation should not have any effects on the environment
* Currently the software is checked by the Roborace team before each competition. When the system is fully implemented, this process might change.
* The implementation of fully autonomous racing vehicles will lead to a redesign of the racing championship, as the racers' personalities play an important role in it. These changes are out of scope of the RMPS project.
