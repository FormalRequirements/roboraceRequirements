== Goals

=== G.1 Overall context and goals
Roborace is a global championship between autonomous cars, that allows testing driverless technology in the extreme conditions of competition. The participating teams get access to a racecar called Robocar and simulation facilities and have to develop the software to drive a Robocar in racing conditions. The teams are not allowed to modify the hardware.

The Roborace provides facilities for driverless technology development and testing. The SIT team aims to use this opportunity to develop software that can be licenced and sold.

The current project focuses on developing the software for Robocar.

=== G.2 Current situation
The hardware is developed and maintained by Roborace. The vehicle is fully ready for autonomous racing and technical specification is provided to the SIT team. 

.[To clarify in the next sprint: 
* What particular information about a racetrack is provided by Roborace
* What software is provided by the Roborace team]

=== G.3 Expected benefits 

Promotion of SIT as the pioneer of driverless racing.

Revenue from the sales of the developed software.

=== G.4 System overview



=== G.5 Limitations and exclusions

.SWOT analysis
[cols="2,2",,]
|===
| *Strengths* | *Opportunities* 
//----------------------------------------------
| Team’s experience in driverless vehicles software research | Develop driverless vehicle software without a need to develop and maintain hardware 
|  |Promote SIT as Roborace attracts public attention
| *Weaknesses* | *Threats*
|  |Dependance on Roborace as they define the race goals and provide testing facilities
|  |Traveling restrictions due to Coronavirus outbreak, resulting in remote collaboration within the team
|=== 
//----------------------------------------------

Risks:

* Missing data regarding vehicle’s pose
* Losing vehicle’s control
* Collision with another vehicle
* Collision with an obstacle
* Driving off the track (all 4 wheels outside of the track)
* Driving off the track partially (3 or less wheels outside of the track)


Risk consequences:

* Not finishing the race
* Light damage of the ego vehicle
* Severe damage of the ego vehicle
* Severe damage of another robocar

=== G.6 Stakeholders
