=== S.4 Use Cases

//----------------------------------------------
.Use Case 1. Move to the pitlane

|  | 
//----------------------------------------------
| Name | Move_to_the_pitlane 
| Scope    | System
| Level| Business summary
| Primary actor| Roborace or AV pilot
| Secondary actor| 
| Context of use| AV has to obey an instruction
| Preconditions| AV has received an order to move to the pitlane

AV is on the racetrack

| Trigger| System receives a request from AV pilot or from the Roborace team
| Main success scenario| * The system calculates the trajectory to the pitlane

* The AV follows the trajectory

* The AV stops at the pit

| Success guarantee| The AV has moved to the pit and stopped
| Extensions| A. There is no safe trajectory to enter the pitlane (due to obstacles)

* The system calculates the closest possible trajectory to the pitlane entrance

* The AV follows the trajectory

* The AV stops at the end of the calculated trajectory

B. The distance is not sufficient for dropping the speed enough to  enter the pitlane without using the emergency brake

* The system calculates the trajectory with making an additional race lap before entering the pitlane

* The AV follows the trajectory

* The AV stops at the pit

| Stakeholders and interests|
* AV Pilot (requests the car to return to pit)

* Roborace management (sets the race goals and policies)

* Roborace team (requests the car to return to pit)

* Roborace operations managers (set up and maintain the hardware)
