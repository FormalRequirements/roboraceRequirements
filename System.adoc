| Secondary actor| 
| Context of use| Racecar has to obey an instruction
| Preconditions| Racecar has received an order to move to the pitlane

Racecar is on the racetrack

| Trigger| System receives a request from Racecar pilot or from the Roborace team
| Main success scenario| * The system calculates the trajectory to the pitlane

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the pit

| Success guarantee| The Racecar has moved to the pit and stopped
| Extensions| A. There is no safe trajectory to enter the pitlane (due to obstacles)

* The system calculates the closest possible trajectory to the pitlane entrance

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the end of the calculated trajectory

B. The distance is not sufficient for dropping the speed enough to  enter the pitlane without using the emergency brake

* The system calculates the trajectory with making an additional race lap before entering the pitlane

* The Racecar follows the trajectory

* The Racecar stops at the pit

| Stakeholders and interests|
* Racecar Pilot (requests the car to return to pit)

* Roborace management (sets the race goals and policies)

* Roborace team (requests the car to return to pit)
